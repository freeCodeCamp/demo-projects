# API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp

###    User stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
