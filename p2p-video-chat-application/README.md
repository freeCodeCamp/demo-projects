# P2P Video Chat Application

## User stories:

1. Upon arriving, the browser will prompt me to access my camera and microphone.
1. After I give it permission, I am prompted to type in a room name.
1. Once I type in the room name, a room will be created if no room of that name existed before.
1. A friend of mine can subsequently go to the same website, type in the same room I entered, and join the same room, then enter into a video chat with me.
1. If I type in a room name, and there are already two people in that room, I get a notification that the room is full.
1. Anyone can create or join any room. And there can be any number of rooms, but all of them must have unique names.
1. I can choose to not permit the site to access my microphone and webcam. If I choose not to do this, or if some other driver problem occurs, I see an error message saying these are required.
1. When I choose to cancel the room name input step, or if I type in no name, or just spaces, it should again ask me again to type in a valid room name.
1. If one of the two people in the room get disconnected, they can reconnect to the same room and continue chatting.
